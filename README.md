# website

This is my personal website, done in a couple hours on a Saturday night, possibly will be getting some upgrades when I can be bothered (e.g. use some proper packages rather than my weird code ramplings from tooltips and hovers, add blog etc.). Want to give lots of credit to [Jack LaFond](https://jack.bio/) whose website I pretty much cloned because I thought he had a cool thing going on and I wanted something to do lol.
